### BIO
I'm Russian by nationality who relocated to Singapore to pursue MSc in Wealth Management as a full-time student at Singapore Management University. For me, it was a step towards making a global career while polishing my knowledge of the financial markets and building a professional skillset.

During my studies, I was fascinated by how new technologies such as AI and Blockchain disrupt the bank industry, and I understood that I want to be part of it. I started to learn Python and R but felt I need more than just studying online courses and joined Masters of IT in Business at SMU.

I am a quick-witted, fast learner, with an intense thirst for knowledge and strive in environments characterized by a steep learning curve. Critical motivators for me are doing things right and been challenged. I enjoy, growing as an individual in my experience, skills, and the humbleness of finding out how little I know. I am proactively learning new skills and upgrading my existing pool of competencies to be a better fit for the future.

My interest lies in the field of Data Science/AI. If you think I will be a good fit for your company, feel free to contact me.
