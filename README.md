## Museums and Hotels in Sankt-Petersburg Density Analysis
### Intorduction to Business Problem
Sankt-Petersburg is a unique tourist city. It has one of, top 3 biggest Museums in the World â€“ the Hermitage, as well as a whole bunch different museums and cultural centers(over 150). In 2018  there were 8,2 million tourists and the number rises every year. At the same time traveling around the city for non-local may be challenging, so right hotel location is the key to success.  

In this project, we will try to find an optimal location for a hotel. We will spot all the museums on the map and made a cluster analysis. After that we will look for location closest to cluster centers and at the same time with lowest hotel density.  
### Data Description
Based on the definition of our problem, the factors that will influence our decision are:

* number of museums
* location of Cultural Cluster Centers
* top venues for each Cultural Cluster Centers

Following data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information:

* Wiki page to find all Sankt-Petersburg museums
* Geocoder to find Longitude and Latitude based on museums addresses
* Foursquare API to find venues near the Cultural Cluster Centers
* Latitude and Lotitude from Google Maps

### Conclusion
There is much asymmetry of information and inefficiencies in the Sankt-Petersburg Hotel market. Most of them are administrative. However, inefficiencies also mean opportunities, and according to my analysis, we were able to spot some of them.

First of all, the vast undersupply of Hostels, if someone has an administrative resource that might be a good business idea to open one or few in Purple or Green Cultural Centers Clusters.

Second underrepresentation of Hotels in blue Cultural Cluster Center, proximity to a City-Center and Main Railway Station are factors which are hard to undervalue.

In the end, for anyone who will look through this report, I hope that at least if not for business purposes, but you now know a bit more about my home town Sankt-Petersburg and his museums. How many out there and where they located. **:)**

### Nostalgia Clause
That is my very first project wich I did before shifting to analythics.
